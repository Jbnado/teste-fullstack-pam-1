# Repo created for a test in pam company

## Project to students registrations

- Back end should be in Python (This is my first REST-API and CRUD in Python)
  - I used flask framework to create the API in python
  - I develop CRUDS to students and courses
  - I used `Python 3.10.6` and `pip 22.0.2`
  - To save data I used tinydb because it's a simple database

### How to run the API

```bash
cd back_end
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 server.py
```

- Front end built with ReactJS
  - I used `Node 18.14.2` and `yarn 1.22.19`
  - I used ANTD design to have a better and faster design
  - I used axios to make requests to the API

### How to run the front end

```bash
cd front_end
yarn
yarn dev
```
